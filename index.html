        <h2>Oppenheimer</h2>
        <p>The story behind the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer</p>

        <p>This movie was very popular at the time of the release, <br>
            being released at the same time as Barbie, the movie <br>
            had much hype around it. Overall, i'd say it lived up <br>
            to much of the hype, as it presented a phenomenal score <br>
            along with amazing visuals and sound effects. Although the <br>
            movie is quite long, i'd say over all the movie is quite <br>
            entertaining and that the director Christopher Nolan did <br>
            an excellent job.
